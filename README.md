# Text-Summarizer-using-Deep-Learning

Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information content and overall meaning. Text Summarization (TS) aims at composing a concise version of an original text, retaining its salient information. Since manual TS is a demanding, time expensive and generally laborious task, automatic TS is gaining increasing popularity and therefore constitutes a strong motivation
for further research.


There are broadly two different approaches that are used for text summarization:

* Extractive Summarization
* Abstractive Summarization

Technologies
* Python
* Keras Library
* TensorFlow
* Jupyter etc.
